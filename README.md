Repository for our first year Three-Thing-Game taking place at the University of Hull Department of Computer Science.

Re-Write
--------
So we decided since that this program could have and should have been written better. We are currently attempting to re-write this game with the newer MonoGame libraries which has the up-to-date content pipeline. The source is located at [Mark-Studios/PixieTag](https://github.com/Mark-Studios/PixieTag).

Compilation & Installation
--------------------------
To compile on Microsoft Windows (7 and 8), you need the XNA libraries from Microsoft and the Monogame Libraries. To edit this file, there is a Visual Studio solution file located at TTG-Game/TTG-Game.sln

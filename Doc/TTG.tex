  \subsection{Life System}
  The player is to receive 3 lives to play with when the game starts. The \texttt{Lives} variable is initialised in the preamble and in the \texttt{LoadGame} method. The Life functionality is provided in the \texttt{Update} method and is triggered by an \texttt{if} statement when the object is exiting the bounding box or `Arena':
  \codelistline{192}{192}{\gameonecode}

  We make use of the Boolean \texttt{LeftArena} to make sure that this code is somehow no run without us foreseeing and to enable a simple while loop for the two case scenarios of the amount of lives left:
  \codelistline{194}{216}{\gameonecode}
  and to keep evaluating an \texttt{if} to check if we lost a life and reset the game with our \texttt{ResetGame} method:
  \codelistline{212}{215}{\gameonecode}

    \subsubsection{Bugs}
    It was found that we actually interpreted the \texttt{Lives} variable in a binary format (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 etc., where we count from zero first) instead of base 10 so when \texttt{Lives} was originally set to the value of $3$, the user was able to have $4$ goes of the game instead. This was simply fixed by initialising \texttt{lives} to $2$ instead since $0$ is counted as a number. We left the algorithm as-is as that's how Mathematics and algorithms should be done.
